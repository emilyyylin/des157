    <h1>PROJECT BRIEF</h1>
  </header>
      <h3>TOPIC SUMMARY</h3><br>
        <p>EZPZ is a collaborative website where college students can engage in eating healthy with diverse foods and recipes. Since a lot of students are very busy taking difficult college courses, holding part time jobs, applying to internships and jobs, they do not have the time to eat healthy meals. This website will help sort the diverse food groups by convenience to carry around, cost to make/prepare/purchase, time to prepare the food, and popularity and favoritism of the meal.</p>
      <h3>TARGET AUDIENCE DESCRIPTION</h3><br>
        <p>My target audience is basically the student community at a University campus. Specifically, I want to target UC Davis students because I have experience here for 4 years, and I have an idea on the different ways to save money and eat good food. It is mainly for those students who work off campus, so it does not really apply to freshmen. </p>
      <h3>GOALS OF THE PROJECT</h3><br>
        <p>Hopefully, this platform will help students eat healthier meals and save money even while being busy, studious students. It will be a website that features cheap and afst food they can purchase around thhe city of Davis, and it will allow students to post their own quick and fast recipies. That way if anyone finds a good deal on something, they can shae it with their community. Also, there will be a meal planner and nutrition guide to teach busy students what to eat and what they are missing.</p>
      <h3>GOALS OF THE OVERALL LOOK AND FEEL</h3><br>
        <p>I want this project to be very playful and easy on the eyes. I dont want it to be difficult to navigate because it is a program or website for busy college students. It will consist of mainly flat line vector art and a lot of images or vectors to help with visuals. The colors will be very friendly - but I am imagining something that is red right now. Type will be very round and sans-serif-y and possibly some brush strokes.</p>
