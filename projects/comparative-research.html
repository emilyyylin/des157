        <p><em>CONTENT OVERVIEW:</em> <br>This article is about Asian-American actors emerging to be advocates for their own visibility. "Whitewashing" is calling out Hollywood for taking Asian roles and stories and utilizing white actors to represent them. Daniel Dae Kim said, "The harsh reality of being an actor is that it's hard to make a living, and that puts actors of color in a very difficult position." Actors such as BD Wong of “Gotham”, George Takei of “Star Trek” and Kumail Nanjiani of “Silicon Valley” have spoken up about Asian-American representation in movies. There is this old stereotypical notion that Asian-American people don’t speak up. The film “Aloha” that was set in Hawaii was filled with white actors, including Emma Stone, who played as a quarter-Chinese, quarter-Native Hawaian fighter pilot named Allison Ng. Just recently, the adaptation of the Japanese manga series Death Note, the hero Light, was played by a white actor Nat Wolff.
        <br><br><em>WEBSITE ANALYSIS:</em><br>The article “Asian-American Actors Are Fighting for Visibility. They Will Not Be Ignored” is written by Amanda Hess and was posted on The New York Times. The website itself was very cluttered when I first logged on. On the header, there is the main menu for The New York Times, and there were colored buttons and a panel of stories displayed with title and images across the top. The New York Times header is static and consists of a menu option of what types of sections offered in the online news website and buttons for people to subscribe and log in. While it is necessary to have people easily find the subscribe or log in option, it seems that these two are very similar in concept – it’s to get people to return to the website. However, once scrolled down, the content of the static header changes into a place where people can recall the title and options to book more the articles. There is also a static footer that shows the rates of full access to the website and the options people can pic from. It also allows an option for people to log in. <br>The body of the article seemed like it had a set margin on the right side because no matter how much I stretch the window horizontally, the text would not go further after a certain point. While scrolling through this article, there were a lot of interruption ads or recommendation to skip to another article. Also, it was helpful to include images through a long scroll of text. Those images were relevant and added much value to the article because it gave the audience an idea of what the actors looked like. When the image is clicked, it doesn’t take you to a new window, but a larger hover image that you can easily “x” out. <br>At the end of the article, there is a portion that shows “Race/Related>>” articles and another column featuring the Trending articles. There is also another menu option at the bottom and the static footer disappears when reached the bottom.

      <p><em>CONTENT OVERVIEW:</em><br> Crop Trust was established by Biodiversity International to help support the global system in a sustainable way. There is priority given to 25 crops listed in Annex 1 of the International Treaty (which is important to the food security of least developed countries.
      <br><br><em>WEBSITE ANALYSIS:</em><br>This website is immediately interactive and fun to look around. There is a main video playing in the background which a white header menu; however, when your mouse scrolls down, the header menu becomes what it looks like a banner and the website is white with a row/section of the video playing. There is also a right column/banner where people can explore current events and other news and share them across different social media platforms. This website is organized by sections scrolling down the home page…with very pleasing graphics and images. On the bottom, there is a gif of a building with smoke passing over it. Also, this website is very responsive to size of the window; however, I found an alignment error in one of their menu options where the text would fall outside of the blue menu drop down. <br> In their About to Our History page, the timeline that illustrates how far this group has come takes up a lot of space which leaves an awkward empty space on the right side. A good way to improve this is to include more images or graphics that go with the text. <br> One of the pages is an interactive map where you can see which locations are shipping out more crops or what kind of crops grows in certain locations. The interactive map is fun and easy to understand; when hovering over the locations, there is a small popup sliding out window from the right with more description about the crop and how/where it is distributed. A lot of information is provided in a short amount of clicking and it is easy to soak in the knowledge gained from visiting the website.
