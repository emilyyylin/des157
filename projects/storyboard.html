      <h3>learning outcomes:</h3>
      <p>Overall, I was able to give the gist of how or where someone would run into this application or website. A lot of students scroll through their Facebook pages instead of doing homework, and they often find some interesting articles about "Quick Ways to Save Money" or "How to Survive in College". The application or website will help BROKE, BUSY, and WANNABE HEALTHY people. This is a platform to share quick, easy, and cheap meals with other users, and it can help you save recipies and meal prep plan. At first, that was what all I had to say about this website; however, after the first round of critiques, I got feedback about sketching more of the website itself and see what it can offer. In the second screenshot, I designed the layout of what a user may run into when using the website. There is an option to sort meals by cost, compactability, meals, and many more. Within each food option, there is a quick run down of all the nutrition facts and tips for users to gain insight into.
