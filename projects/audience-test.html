      <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
      <p>I am an extreme noob at coding. There are a lot of things that are not complete, but the basic structure and idea is there. In the end, users are able to input zipcode and it will filter the location of where you can purchase the food items (if that option is selected). There will also be a filter where you can sort through the different foods that you may be allergic to. I will also be adding more food items for the "purchased goods" and "recipes" and more fun facts about nutrition. I spent more time on my other final project because it's due in two days, and I'll be working on this a lot this coming week and next week. (Sorry (-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩___-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩) )</p>

      <h3>EZPZ</h3>
      <p>EZPZ is an app made mainly for people to be able to find cheap, easy, and healthy foods. It not only directs you to menu items in certain restaurants, but also directs you to which items in the near by market place that's convenient to purchase. On top of that, there is a platform for users to upload their own recipes and other users can create profiles and save/rate their favorite recipes. <br></p>
