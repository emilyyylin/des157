      <h3>The Importance of Food Diversity // Obesity</h3>
        <p>The global food diversity is declining. While the consumption of meat and processed foods increases, diet-related diseases (diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer) increases as well. With the obesity rates constantly increasing, the children today could be the first generation to live shorter and less healthy lives than their parents. Not only is obesity a vast health issue, it is also a financial issue, national security issue, community safety issue, child development/academic achievement issue, and many more. To begin with, it is a very extreme financial issue because billions of dollars are lost in obesity prevention. Health care is becoming extremely expensive in many states, which is a problem for employers who want to operate businesses in places that are more productive and has lower healthcare costs. Being obese is also a cause of disqualifications in service members in military…as well as those who serve as first responders for our communities. Amongst children, their development and academic achievement is correlated with increased risk for bullying and depression. To become more well-rounded, they must have equal balance of food and play.
        <br><br>While rates of obesity rates began stabilizing in some way or another, there must still be strategies implemented to continue stabilizing the rates. The most helpful strategy is focused on helping children maintain a healthy weight…. it’s easier to prevent obesity, than reverse it. Some of the key strategies involve ensuring healthier foods, such as providing a variety of food and drink options in school or child care settings, supporting food and beverage companies to sell healthy and affordable options, and preparing a more diverse plate of healthy foods at home.

      <h3>Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Diabetes occurs when your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high, and insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood (which is bad). There are two types of diabetes, type 1 is where your body does not make insulin, and type 2 (which is more common and commonly caused by poor diet) is where your body does not make or use insulin well. An effective way to control diabetes is to do frequent exercises and dieting. Awareness in the consumption of foods and exercise can either help alleviate or postpone the negatives of having diabetes.

      <h3>Lack of Diversity Threatens our Food System</h3>
        <P>With the narrow range of crop diversity, it causes a threat to our food supply. We also have a problem due to climate change and other vulnerabilities that sacrifice diversity. For example, 80-90% of wheat varieties grown worldwide are susceptible to the Ug99 race of stem rust – which was a huge threat to global wheat production. It has come to the government’s attention that they need to safeguard against the pests and disease outbreaks, so consumers and farmers can preserve agricultural biodiversity. Global food production must become more diverse and including with species that are widely grown, which will be ending up being better equipped to withstand hostile climates and disease.
