      <p>For the audience testing, I only had one person review my project. I was struggling with coding from the beginning, and I feel like I didn't have enough content for any user to effectively test what I had. Something that was more shocking to me was the alert I set up in the beginning to use iPhone7 view and the user did not follow directions. The user basically continued on with the website and ingored all the instructions. I also listed clear directions that certain things doesnt work, but they overlook it and jump into what they think they know. It was slightly painful to watch that, but I guess it's something that I need to make sure in the future to learn how to make responsive web design. I have been reflecting, and I think that my idea for this project was a bit too ambitious for someone who is a noob at coding. At this point, I think I'm going to start over, and think of somethign a lot simpler yet still challenging in some ways. I feel like with a more playful final project, I can demonstrate my graphic side a bit more.
